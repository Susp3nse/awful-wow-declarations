# Typescript declarations for the current live World of Warcraft LUA API

> WoW Classic developers should use the [wow-classic-declarations](https://github.com/wartoshika/wow-classic-declarations) repository.

## Shadowland

Updates for the Shadowland expansion are currently in development. You can find a partial implementation on the master branch.
Once every function has been documented i will release it into a dedicated version.

**Supported transpilers for LUA targets**:
- qhun-transpiler ([GitHub-Page](https://github.com/wartoshika/qhun-transpiler))
- TypescriptToLua ([GitHub-Page](https://github.com/TypeScriptToLua/TypeScriptToLua)) - *Thanks to tstirrat*

## Setup

Installing this dependency via

- `$ npm install @wartoshika/wow-declarations@8.3.0-release.1` (npm repository installation)
- `$ npm install wartoshika/wow-declarations#v8.3.0-release.1` (github repository installation)

> I strongly recommend to use a version tag when using github based install. Referencing the master branch can result in installing a breaking change. Github based installations need a prefixing `v` in the version number!

Please add the wow-declarations path to your `tsconfig.json` compiler options like below:

```js
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        // ...
        "typeRoots": [
            "./node_modules/@types",
            "./node_modules/@wartoshika/wow-declarations"
        ]
    }
}
```
